## What we will cover

1. Syllabus and expectations

2. Counting and how we will proceed

3. The many faces of data

## What do you think?

- Pilots should love to know the defects in their planes. Unreliability aids the informativeness needed to make difficult decisions, like landing in bad weather.

- Organizations that have good rainy day funds are more valuable than those that use their cash to buy back stock. When the rain arrives, and it always does, cash will keep jobs and businesses afloat.

- Probability does not exist, neither do means and standard deviations.

- Any distribution of anything that can be described only by means and standard deviations is (plausibly) the least informative.

- Why do cooks eat their own food (or should)? If the cook fails, the cook suffers and may die, thus eliminating very dangerous people from the planet. (a saying of Taleb)

## Progress

### noun or verb? or both?

Do until (days left in the semester == 0) OR (you have not completed your learning of a topic) 

1.	Prepare for each week through reading, research, practice, and marching through the videos

2.	Live sessions to reinforce key topics and the solving of posed problems

3.	Questions and answers and follow-up on THE WALL for the next round

## Getting to yes

### modus ponens plausibility

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
#caption <- "modus ponens plausibility"
major <- "if A is true, then B is true"
minor <- "B is true"
conclusion <- "thus, A becomes more plausible"
argument <- rbind(major, minor, conclusion)
knitr::kable(argument, align = "c" ) %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(2, hline_after = T) %>% 
  column_spec(1, width = "7em", bold = TRUE, italic = TRUE)
```

## Truth or consequences

```{r modus-ponens-truth}
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)

caption <- "modus ponens truth table"
  
truth <- data.frame(
  P0 = c(T, T, F, F),
  Q0 = c(T, F, T, F),
  ifPthenQ = c(T, F, T, T),
  P1 = c(T, T, F, F),
  Q1 = c(T, F, T, F)
)

colnames(truth) <- c("P", "Q", "if P then Q", "P", "Q")

kable(truth, align = "c", caption = caption, escape = FALSE) %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```


## Plausible deniability

### modus tollens plausibility

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
#caption <- "modus tollens plausibility"
major <- "if A is true, then B is true"
minor <- "A is false"
conclusion <- "thus, B becomes less plausible"
argument <- rbind(major, minor, conclusion)
knitr::kable(argument, align = "c" ) %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>% 
  row_spec(2, extra_latex_after = "\\cline(2)")%>% 
  column_spec(1, width = "7em", bold = TRUE, italic = TRUE)
#%>% row_spec(1, hline_after = T)
```

## What's the story?

1. Concoct a data story

2. Condition the story with data observations

3. Critique the conditioned data story

##  Suppose this

- We know there are positive and negative cases of a new virus in 4 zip codes.

- Three data collectors observe at random and independently a positive, then a negative, then another positive zip code. The sites might all have the same zips or not.

- We ask: how many of the 4 zip codes test positive?

## In R this looks like ...


```{r grid-1, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rethinking)
n <- 1000
n_success <- 6
n_trials  <- 8
(
  binomial_model <-
  tibble(p_grid = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = n),
         # note we're still using a flat uniform prior
         prior  = 1) %>% 
  mutate(likelihood = dbinom(n_success, size = n_trials, prob = p_grid)) %>% 
  mutate(posterior = (likelihood * prior) / sum(likelihood * prior))
)
summary( binomial_model )
```

## A picture helps

```{r grid-1-plot, echo = TRUE}
library(tidybayes) # Mode() helper function
library(plotly) # make the plot interactive
# how many samples would you like
n_samples <- 10000 # 1e4
# make it reproducible
set.seed(42) # Hitchhiker's Guide
samples <-
  binomial_model %>% 
  sample_n( size = n_samples, weight = posterior, replace = TRUE )
#
y_label <- "h = proportion of positive tests"
x_label <- "sample index"
title <- "Zip Code Tests: Bronx"
p_MAP <- Mode(samples$p_grid) #MAximum A Posteriori point estimate
title <- "Bronx Zip Code Tests"
x_label <- "proporation of zip codes testing positive"
y_label <- "posterior density"
plt <- samples %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = p_grid)) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_x_continuous(x_label, limits = c(0, 1)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=p_MAP, color = "orange", size = 1.3) +
  annotate( "text", x = 0.50, y = 2, label = paste0("MAP = ", round(p_MAP, 4)) ) +
  ylab(y_label) + xlab(x_label) +
  ggtitle(title)
# ggplotly(plt) Uncomment this to see the plot next
```

## The plot thickens

```{r a-plot-emerges, echo = F}
ggplotly(plt)
```


## The whole course is here

### First

We set up a context, a story that has data associated with it:
  
  - 4 zip codes
  
  - positive and negative tests

## The whole course is here

### Second

We collected 3 observations in various zip codes, conditioned the data against the observations

  - 5 hypotheses, theories, models conjectured

  - Conditioned the models with observations

  - Counted (finally admitting this!) the ways a model is consistent with data

  - Consistency means can the data imply a model (LOGIC!)

## The whole course is here

### Third

We analyzed the ways and found the plausibility of each model; we then might have been forced by our employer to select the most plausible theory
  
  - Probability, Likelihood, is Plausibility
  
  - Ways normed by their sum
  
  - Only one theory is most probable: sample, sample, sample
  
## The many faces of data

## For example

- Blue and red

- Plausibility

- Direction

- Time

- Troop strength

- Temperature

- Geo-coordinates

## What's a hierarchy?

A hierarchy is an analytical technique that takes a group of objects and asks two questions:

1. How are the objects (nodes) related to one another (edges)? (just a network)

2. What objects are parents (higher level) or children (lower level) of one another

## A data hierarchy emerges

        dot = 'dinetwork{ node [shape=box];  
           "Data" -> "Numeric" ;

           "Numeric" -> "Continuous" ;
           "Numeric" -> "Discrete" ;
           "Categorical" -> "Nominal" ; 
           "Categorical" -> "Ordinal" ; 
           }'
           ) %>%  visNodes(color = list(background = "white", border = "blue", 
    highlight = "yellow")) %>% visHierarchicalLayout(nodeSpacing = 200, sortMethod = "directed") %>%

## Load and inspect data

- Open NYC Data has NYPD complaint data for the past few months at <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-YTD/5uac-w243/data>

- A simple `lat` and `lon` (latitude and longitude) scatter plot will indicate light and dark areas for us to inspect the data.

## Summarise { .smaller}

```{r bx-crime-load}
#Load data

bx_crime <- read_csv("bx-crime.csv")


# Inspect data

tail(bx_crime[,c(2, 10, 22:23)])
```

## Scatter plot

  ggsave("bx-scatter.jpg")
